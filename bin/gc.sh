$(basename "$0") cleans up tagged or untagged images pushed before specified date
for a given repository (an image name without a tag/digest).

USAGE:
  gcrgc.sh REPOSITORY DATE

EXAMPLE
  gcrgc.sh gcr.io/greenpeace/php-fpm 2017-04-01

  would clean up everything under the gcr.io/greenpeace/php-fpm repository
  pushed before 2017-04-01.

TRIAL RUN
  Setting the environment variable will display a list of all images that would
  be deleted.

  TRIAL_RUN=1 gcrgc.sh gcr.io/greenpeace/php-fpm 2017-04-01

  Would list all image digests that would be deleted.
